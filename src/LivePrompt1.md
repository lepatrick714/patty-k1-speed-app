Btw I'm just adding the steps for demo purposes. 

Okay so this repo handles the google email authenications for us to pull their K1 Speed races with the output looking like the md file I've pasted. 

Create a K1 Speed View Race History WebPage (Don't currently have anything yet. Double check the current work space for what we currently have which is just the mere parsers) using React (nextJS), TypeScript, Tailwind.css. 

You will also need a backend to host / serve the traffic so do host the api server on port 443. Create a Node (ExpressJS) and TypeScript API Server with your typical crud operations. 

Now please use the context above and create me a README file that's formated just right for github copliot / AI to take over this work! 

Remember to add validations checks. Rember to setup Step by Steps instructions so that the AI takes the work in managable chunks.
