We need to add another page called tracks. 

There's a couple of components you will need to create. Per the wireframe going from top to bottom. 

You will still have the same navigation header / bar panel. 

At the bottom of that you will have 2 vertically aligned panels. Denoted below 

First is the Racer's Selector Panel which should be on the 

Here there would be two panels where the left panel is 1/3rd and th right covers the other 2/3rds. Ensure that they have all the modern paddings / margins and overall pretty / lit af look 

Note that the left panel is completely just one panel whilst the right panel is build from 2 panels column wise

The first top panel of the right section should be 10% of height in which it will be the racer's / track selector. Couple of requirements regarding this selector, 

- two selectors, one for the track and one for the racers 
- Both must be selected before  the graph (second panel / bottom panel of the right section) can render. 
- The user MUST pick a track options first. Make sure the second selector (i.E. the racer) is disabled. Ensure the styling for hover / disable and everything is consitent with UI / UX principles 
- Once the user selects a track, that's when you'll render the bar graph showing the racer's best lap time progression. 

For the second half of the right section, you'll have a bar graph where the y axis represent the best lap time and the x axis represents the date of the race. 

For the tech stack, for graphs recommend using chartsjs. 

Now per the context above please draft me a good prompt to give to the AI to build this new page out!

Remember to mention to search / explore around the current codebase for what's already built so that they can acturally point out the files needed to cahnge / be created. 

Make the prompt as detailed as possible INCLUDING validations steps AND a step by step guidelines so that the AI would break up the work into phases
